OWASP Category: M4: 2016 Insecure Authentication

Severity :   Medium  

Complexity : Easy 

From : Remote / External

Steps to Reproduce:

Proof of Concept : Attached in the Video


Impact : An Adversary can bypass the authentication mechanism used and can hence takeover the account of the user. The only disadvantage is the physical access of the device is needed.

Affected Path: Entire Application

Recommendations : 
The application should implement User Presence validation by using kSecAccessControlUserPresence attributes. Boolean based values should not be given in response which can be easily modified by an automated tool such as Frida instead try encrypting the response.
