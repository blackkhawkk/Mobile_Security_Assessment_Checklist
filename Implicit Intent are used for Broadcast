Severity :   Medium

From : Remote / External

Steps to Reproduce:

Proof of Concept : Attached in the Video


Impact : An Adversary can intercept the traffic by using malicious apps since the applications send broadcasts without specifying the broadcast target.

Affected Path: Entire Application

Recommendations : 
Applications should use explicit Intents for IPC. If the intent is only broadcasted in the same application, LocalBroadcastManager should be used.
