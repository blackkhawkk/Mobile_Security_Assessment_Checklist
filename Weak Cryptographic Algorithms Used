Weak Cryptographic Algorithms Used

Summary : It was observed that weak cryptographic algorithms were used in the application for encryption and hashing.

OWASP Category: M5: Insufficient Cryptography

Severity :   Low  

Complexity : Easy 

From : Remote / External

Steps to Reproduce:

Proof of Concept : Attached in the Video

Impact : An Adversary can break the ciphered code gaining access to the plain text message hence impacting the Confidientiality and the Integrity of the data.

Affected Path: Entire Application

Recommendations :  The application should implement strong hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and SHA-512.
