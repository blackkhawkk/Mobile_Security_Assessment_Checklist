OWASP Category: M3: 2016 Insecure Communication

Severity :   Medium  

Complexity : Easy 

From : Remote / External

Steps to Reproduce:

Proof of Concept : Attached in the Video


Impact : An Adversary can intercept traffic that goes through application easily using a proxy.

Affected Path: Entire Application

Recommendations : 
The application should implement proper SSL Pinning. Whenever the application is communicating with the server it should validate if the traffic has been encrypted with the same key that matches the public key included in the application or not. Boolean based values should not be given in response which can be easily modified by an automated tool such as Frida instead try encrypting the response.
